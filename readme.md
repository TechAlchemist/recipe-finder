## Future Enhancements
1. Convert to either PHP framework like Laravel or technology stack like MERN.
    - Secure user login and account creation: password salting/hashing and auth tokens. THE WORKS!
2. Move away from relational database for practice purposes. 
3. Hide API keys and setup env files. 
4. Check for duplicate records before insertion of favorite recipe. 

## Project Challeneges and Takeaway

The biggest challenge by far was making PHP and JQuery play nicely together. It showed me I do not like PHP that much and that modern frameworks like Node are much more oriented to the task.
